- Question 1: "Explain how you chose the inheritance hierarchy in Task 1, making reference to the Open-Closed Principle."




- Question 2: "Explain how you implemented each of the sanity checks in Task 4."

There were four conditions that were supposed to be satisfied:

- The method gas should only accept values between 0 and 1.
- The method gas should never decrease a car's speed.
- The method brake should only accept values between 0 and 1.
- The method brake should never increase a car's speed.

We chose to make a single sanity check for each method that satisfy all four conditions.
Our solution simply made sure the multiplier which is returned by the gas and break function
always remains within an interval of 0 and 1. It is obvious that this satisfies two of our
conditions, however it also satisfies the other two conditions by making sure that we never
get negative values as arguments. Naturally, this
